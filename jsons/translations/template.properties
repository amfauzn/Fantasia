Polgar Sod'em is a historical kingdom in the southern continent of Pangaea. Together with 'Nkuhanea, Eldariya, and Chorislavia, it was one of four early civilizations of Pangaea, and of the four, the only dwarfs civilization. Its sites spanned an area from much of Somarum Hill, to north Binnaka, and southeastern Avalonia. Its culture played a crucial role during the Eldariya dynasty that annexed Polgar Sod'em, when the Sodite language remained and the rest of its buildings became the inspiration for Eldariya's greatness. The concepts of Construct and Golem were first coined among the Sodites. =

As the dominant power of the eastern part of central Pangea, Eldariya inevitably came into conflict with many neighbors and rivals, from the indigenous Chorislaviani of Central Pangea to the nascent Almuria. Following the conflict and annexation of Nubkhecris, its growing competition with Almuria culminated in the Mudariya Wars, which saw some of the largest battles in history. Eldariya narrowly avoided destruction after the Third Mudariya War, and was destroyed by the Almurians after the fourth and final Mudariya War. All remnants of the Eldars civilization came under Almuria rule, and Almuria subsequently became the dominant power, paving the way for its rise as a major empire. Almuria, howerver, decided not to mess with the Crypt of the Unliving because of the Tomb Guard, an entity they had never seen before. =

Almuria was an empire that controlled Manas Island, Shangri-La, and parts of Pangea, from Kumari Kandam to Mamuju, excluding Akhetutan, Sabata, and Noenna. It was founded on Manas Island in the town of Lemuria by the Almurian tribal leader Ishana. After five years of establishment, Almuria crossed into Pangea and, with the conquest of Erum and the annexation of Shangri-La along the way, Almuria was transformed into an empire.

Under the reign of Fala Vieya, Almuria marked the peak of its power and prosperity. After moving the imperial capital to Avalonia, Almuria released Akhetutan, Sabata, and Noenna in exchange of the Tridstone. In collaboration with the Sodites, Almuria developed a series of new technologies centered upon the discovery of an inexhaustible source of energy. This energy was genertaed by extracting litle by litle energy from Tridstone using the Aurelionate Device. During a test of the device, a massive energy pulse violently radiated outward and destroyed Almuria, causing it to sink into the sea and trigger the world's disaster. The energy pulse affected the survivors biologically, causing them to gain the ability to breathe underwater and the superhuman strength needed to survive in the deep ocean. =

Long after conquering and destroying the Western First Order, the Morlovians set their sights on Machinia to quell their thirst for blood. During that time, the Machinicus already worshiped Machine-God Machina and had mostly modified small parts of their bodies with machines. The Morlovians were initially confident in their abilities but they soon discovered that the Machinians were impervious to the vampire's bites, and their weapons were too powerful for the vampires to withstand.

During the reign of Galamar II, the kingdom expanded its territory to the borders of the Rain Forest and Berenger Kingdom in the south and The Kingdom of Malus in the southwest. Because he controlled a very large area in the north, Galamar II and his successors were given the honorary title of The King in the North. After the death of Galamar V at the Battle of Malus, Valadorn took over leadership of the kingdom, forcing Galamar VI into exile in Berenger Kingdom, and went into hiding in the Dukedom of Nas. =

The Kingdom of Malus is a state in south-central Laurasia and is bordered by the Berenger Kingdom in the southeast and the Thorin Empire in the northeast.

Rouben's successor as the 4th Karaeng of Shaquad was his eldest son Temuraz, while his younger brother Artyom crossed the Lake Tandano and established the Kingdom of Malus. After the ascension of Barret, envoys of the Thorin Empire delivered an ultimatum to Barret. Under the Thorans terms, Malus would have been required to disband his army and accept Thorin's sovereignty. Barret refused, and the war between Malus and Thorin began. =

After becoming emperor of Thorin, Valadorn attacked Malus again. With better strategy and logistics, the Thorans decisively defeated the Malusian army.

Nas was a duchy under Berenger Kingdom located on the Tanait plains in the north-central part of Laurasia. The exact location of the Dukedom of Nas is in the southernmost part of the Kingdom of Berenger, bordered with Clockwerk to the East and Nevdes to the West. After Valadorn took over leadership of Thorin, Galamar VI went into exile in the Berenger Kingdom and was made the Duke of Nas by King Vayne for his contributions in the Battle of Raven's Roost and the Siege of Rosemount. =

After the Fall of Thorin and the formation of an alliance between Saeth and King Yergtan, Galamar urged the King to rethink his decision. The King refused to listen and ordered his army to march against Nas Dukedom. Realizing he couldn't win, Galamar accepted Nualla's offer to form the Aeyris Alliances, and managed to persuade the alliances to lend their troops in the war against Berenger's army. In the Battle of Laromon, Galamar killed Saeth using the legendary sword Flamespitter. =

When Saeth conquered Thorin, Nualla realized that the Niranni needed to form an alliance with other kingdoms to protect themselves and their home. She reached out to the Berenger Kingdom, Canthyria, Clockwek, and Nevdes hoping to create a multi-race alliance against Saeth. However, her efforts were in vain, as the Berenger Kingdom chose to side with Urg and revealed their secret plan to Saeth. Saeth, now armed with this knowledge, easily conquers Niranna and Canthyria. The situation changed when the Dryads of the Rain Forest rose up against Saeth, summoning the power of the forest to defeat his army and drive him back.

A dark place, Rain Forest inhabited by the Rainee, consisting of dryads, hamadryads, ents, and any other non-hostile species hunted in the outside world. Initially, the Rainee were reluctant to take action in the Great War of Laurasia, as they preferred to observe and protect the natural world rather than engage in conflict.

During the Battle of Niranna, the Dryads of Rain Forest, with the help of Ents, rose up against Saeth, summoning the power of the forest to defeat his army and drive him back.

Despite not taking part in the Battle of Laromon, the Rainee's attack on Ancient Citadel and disrupting Malakar's supply greatly contributed to the Aeyris Alliances victory.

Giants are a non-human race considered to be a legend by the inhabitants outside of Laurasia. However, giants do actually exist in Nusa Islands, and never interact with the outside world. The first civilization the giants interacted with was Dwargon, when a group of giants called Förstarna, or the First Giants, crossed the Vänern Sea and settled on the Horn of Laurasia, with whom they periodically clashed. The Second Giants, Andarna, came during the Dissolution of Berenger. The giants, under the leadership of Magnar, formed a mercenary group of giants because of their power and the difficulty of finding plentiful food.

The Sulvani Elves are a group of elves who are famous for their love of music, singing, and arts. They inhabit the land of Java in the southern reaches of Rain Forest, but many of them later migrate to Blathan Jungle. Both groups of elves, Niranna and Sulvana, are descendants of the Chorislaviani, and coexist under one banner. However, the Sulvani later became distant from the Niranni, as the Niranni's desire for power and control caused tension between the two groups. = 
 # Requires translation!
The most prominent figure of Sulvana is Queen Lulla Artiana, who leads her people in the struggle against Zorgorath's forces. The counterattack led by Lulla was carried out after Zorgorath and most of his troops had departed for the Nevdes through the Endless Door. In the Liberation of the Blathan Jungle, Lulla manages to kill Azaniroth and closes the Slumbering Gate, one of the gates of the Endless Door, to prevent Zorgorath's army coming back through the portal. Later, she joined the Aeyris Alliances and built the Aschar Grove for the alliances. =

Urush was a demonic state led by Zorgorath the Black Hand. Coming from the netherworld, Zorgorath was summoned by Bulvan, who attempted to resurrect his family, but instead, opened a portal to the netherworld. Realizing the situation, Zorgorath intends to create his own branch of Hell and establish himself as its sole ruler. During its peak, Urush managed to conquer proud Sulvana, wealthy Nevdes, the nascent Kingdom of Nas, including the former area of the Berenger Kingdom and the Thorin Empire, and many areas under the control of Bulvan  and Ttarmek. =

Coming from the netherworld, Zorgorath was summoned by Bulvan, who attempted to resurrect his family, but instead, opened a portal to the netherworld. Realizing the situation, Zorgorath intends to create his own branch of Hell and establish himself as its sole ruler. Wary that his arrival would be disturbed by the Aeyris Alliances, while he needed preparation to summon his army, Zorgorath devised a plan to stall time. He taught Bulvan the perfect art of necromancy and the path of lichdom, and at the same time he corrupted Bulvan's mind with hatred and anger towards the alliances. He orchestrated Bulvan's revenge, which marked the start of the Second Laurasian War. = 
 # Requires translation!
Shortly after Bulvan's defeat, Zorgorath speed up his plan and attacked Sulvana sooner than he had planned, seeking to raid their city and crush the Sulvani elves resistance to his rule before his enemies could fortify it. At the same time, Zorgorath sent Erhab to attack Dwargon and the Trolls to attack Nevdes. After successfully conquering Sulvana, Zorgorath and most of his army departed for the Nevdes via the Endless Door, leaving behind a small force led by Azaniroth. Before being defeated by the Aeyris Alliances, Zorgorath and his army managed to conquer proud Sulvana, wealthy Nevdes, the nascent Kingdom of Nas, including the former area of the Berenger Kingdom and the Thorin Empire, and many areas under the control of Bulvan  and Ttarmek. =

Red Moon is an organization that takes in and protects witches from across the Laurasia. The organization was originally formed by a few witches, including Veronika, in the Sea Wind Region who wished to protect themselves from persecution. They made their shelter in a forest and avoided contact with the outside world. After their shelter being attacked, Veronika decided to use the information in a book she called the Holy Book, to lead her sisters to the Sabbath, a place rumored to be where witches can go through their Day of Awakening with no pain and live peacefully. = 
 # Requires translation!
Despite their efforts, the witches couldn't locate the Sabbath. Along the way, they encounter Claudia, who has the ability to read the hidden messages contained in the book. Turns out the book keeps secrets about the Moon Thread, a project to trap the entire world in a dream, thus saving mankind from destroying itself but also robbing free will from the entire world. However, the project needs a magical stone called the Tridstone, which was lost during the Doom of the Old World. Losing their hopes, Claudia then established a settlement in Blasicken for the witches. Later, she was approached by Queen Nualla to join the Aeyris Alliances and fight against Zorgorath. =

Frostmorrow, also called The Frozen Empire, was a powerful empire of Central Omora that stretched from Samara in the North to Samara in the North. It grew to become the largest Frosten-speaking state and rose through the outstanding organizational skills of the Frostmorrow people, wealth gained from trade of Cultivated farm yields, and their adaptability to the ferocity of the cold. The Frozen Empire was one of the most politically important states in the entirety of Central Omora, and held sway not only over most of the other kingdoms in Central Omora, but also over nearby North Omora states, notably the Leonin Kingdom. =

Beginning with the reign of Hassel, Frostmorrow minted its own coins, which have been excavated in locations as far north as Samara, in the Frittond Hill near the Caesarea Forest. The kingdom continued to expand throughout late antiquity, conquering Frostwaste, from whom it inherited the exonym 'Frozen'. The Frostmorrowi dominance in the region culminated during the reign of Tormund Drake, who invaded the Odeila Kingdom in order to avenge the dead of his adopted son by King Atley. With the annexation of Odeila, the Kingdom of Frostmorrow reached its largest territorial extent. However, the kingdom known only by those inhabited in the Continent of Omora as Omora is surrounded by 3 major oceans, namely the Lamuri Ocean, the Bravorlr Ocean, and the Firorr Ocean. =
